# Midinome-Arduino
Midinome Board definition for Arduino

this seems to be working. If you unzip and drop it into the documents/arduino/hardware/ and reset IDE (if there is a tools directory there already you would need to merge them obv)

Windows

C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Arduino\hardware

if hardware folder exists, copy 'midinome' and 'tools' folder inside. If hardware folder does not exist, you need to create it.

Mac

Instructions Pending


In Arduino you should now see 'Ultrapalace' and 'Nomeduino' under Tools -> Board
